Important Notes:

Security: The script uses a username and password for simplicity. For a production environment, use SSH keys and a secret manager for credentials.
VM Size: The VM size "Standard_B1s" is an example. Check Azure's VM size documentation to ensure it fits your 2 GB RAM requirement.
Provisioner: The local-exec provisioner is used to wait for 20 minutes (1200 seconds) and then SSH into the VM to install Zeek and Suricata. Ensure your local machine has SSH access to the VM.
SSH Keys: You'll need to set up SSH keys and possibly adjust the security rules to allow SSH access for the local-exec provisioner to work.
