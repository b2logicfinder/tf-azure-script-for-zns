Important Notes:

Security: The script uses a username and password for simplicity. For a production environment, use SSH keys and a secret manager for credentials.
VM Size: The VM size "Standard_B1s" is an example. Check Azure's VM size documentation to ensure it fits your 2 GB RAM requirement.
Provisioner: The local-exec provisioner is used to wait for 20 minutes (1200 seconds) and then SSH into the VM to install Zeek and Suricata. Ensure your local machine has SSH access to the VM.
SSH Keys: You'll need to set up SSH keys and possibly adjust the security rules to allow SSH access for the local-exec provisioner to work.
-----
Notes:

Inline Commands: The remote-exec provisioner will SSH into the machine and execute the commands listed under inline. This replaces the local-exec provisioner and the need for sleep.

Connection Block: The connection block is used to define how Terraform will connect to the instance. Adjust the type, user, and host as necessary. For production, use SSH keys instead of passwords for enhanced security.

Timing: This script does not include a delay before executing the commands. If you find that the VM isn't ready when the commands run, you might need to include a retry mechanism or a brief wait period as part of your script.

Security: As a best practice, don't embed passwords directly into Terraform scripts. Consider using a secret manager or at least environment variables to handle sensitive data.
